## Running the Project

To run the project locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the server on port 8000:

   ```
   python -m http.server 8000

4. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html

This will serve the project files and allow you to use the website as intended.
